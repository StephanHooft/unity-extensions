# unity-tools
This repo is a Unity package for C# code I'd like to reuse across projects. It contains:
- Extension methods for various classes.
- A MultiKeyDictionary class.
- Classes to set up (finite) state machines.
- A Progress class to track progress of tasks.
- A custom pooler for Components.
- Custom attributes.
- A "HybridUpdate" system to update Monobehaviours whenever FixedUpdate is called, as well as when multiple Update calls occur between FixedUpdates.
- Tools for drawing and following (segmented) lines in 2D space.
